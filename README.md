Reaction Game on Arduino
This is a simple reaction game I built using an Arduino and an LCD screen. The goal is to press a button as fast as possible when an LED lights up. The game gets harder with each level as the reaction time requirement decreases.

How It Works:
The game starts at Level 1, and you’ll have 500ms to react.
A random LED lights up, and you need to press the button as fast as possible.
If you press the button in time, your reaction time is displayed, and you move to the next level.
The game gets harder because the reaction time required decreases with each level.
If you react too slowly or don’t press the button in time, it’s Game Over.
If you make it to the fastest required time, you win.

Key Features:
Random LED Selection: The game picks a random LED for each round.
Reaction Time Tracking: Displays how fast you pressed the button.
Progressive Difficulty: The time limit decreases as you advance.
Game Over and Victory Messages: If you lose or win, the LCD displays the result.
How to Play
Upload the code to your Arduino.
Connect everything as described above.
Power the Arduino.
The game will display “Level 1” on the LCD.
Wait for an LED to light up and press the button as fast as you can.
Keep progressing to higher levels. Try to beat the game!
Notes
This is another fun beginner project I worked on to improve my Arduino skills. It’s a mix of programming, electronics, and reaction testing! Feel free to build on it or tweak it to make it even cooler.
